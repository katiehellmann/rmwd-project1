Project 1 Milestone Responses
What dataset are you using?
I will be using the provided Books dataset found in the myCourses Shell.

What went right in the development of this project?
I was readily able to write to files appropriately. I also liked styling the UI even though I didn't completely style the outputs. I also ended up rehauling the html from the borrowed http api assignment so I could better understand what was going on inside of it.


What went wrong in the development of this project?
Somewhere during my process I accidently changed the response object and it took me a very long while to figure out which function I did so in. It ended up being an error with how I was sending objects into the parsing function. 

What did you learn while developing this project?
I shouldn't be developing is long stints. I need to take a step back so I can has fresh eyes on my errors. I also was able to better learn GET, HEAD, and POST requests.

If you went above and beyond, how did you do so?
I know this isn't the most 'beyond' work, but I chose to add styling with the TailwindCSS framework! 

If you used any borrowed code or code fragments, where did you get them from?
There may be some residual logs for debugging courtesy of ChatGPT. There is also some from the previous http api assignments/parsing demos.

What do the code fragments do? Where are they in your code?
The logs ensure the code is working correctly and still returning the correct response output. In addition, there are a few methods that I denoted in the milestone- htmlResponses.js, jsonResponses.js, and server,js either reference code from the parsing demo or sets up serving files the way that the http api assignments do.
