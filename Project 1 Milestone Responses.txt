Project 1 Milestone Responses
What dataset are you using?
I will be using the provided Books dataset. 
I plan to be able to filter the books by author, language, year (time frame) and genre. In addition, the user should be able to add a book and mark books as 'read'.

What work has been completed for this milestone?
The client page (HTML) has been updates to reflect the endpoints, including both the get and post requests. At the moment, every submit button returns an error.

What work is left, and how do you plan to complete it?
I have to implement the functionally that returns/posts endpoint data. I essentally need to make it functional.
Do you have a plan for going above and beyond? If so, what is it?
I plan to customize the frontend (styling) of the api to be more user friendly and potentially look like a bookshelf/library. This will most likely come in the form of using TailwindCSS or a similar framework.

If you used any borrowed code or code fragments, where did you get them from?
The majority of the current code has been copied from the previous HTTP API Assignments/parsing demos. It will need to be refactored to properly handle the endpoints listed above.

What do the code fragments do? Where are they in your code?
There are fragments in the following files: htmlResponse.js, jsonResponses.js and server.js. As mentioned above, they are referenced from demos given to us in class!
